>WAWU is iconic. We have made history with our union, with our contract, with our organizing. Other undergraduate unions are looking to us, other community organizations are looking to us. We should continue to collaborate with these unions and organizations and continue to share our insights.

In the past year or so, WAWU has re-energized the labor atmosphere on campus. WFSE, PSE, UFWW, and SEIU are all learning from WAWU, and we are learning from them. We call this collective group of campus unions "WUWU" for Western Union Workers United. What we've done with the other unions on campus we can do across Washington, across the region, across the country.

We've provided help and expertise to other union campaigns across the country through peer mentorship for the UAW's Youth Labor Organizing Corps this summer. We've shared our experience with the undergrads at the University of Oregon, Central Washington University, and the broad Student Worker Alliance Network--a group of undergraduate unions who've loosely amalgamated.

But there's so much more to do: WAWU should keep joining together with other unions on campus to change Western for the better. We should join with unions across Washington to improve higher ed. We should keep collaborating with the national undergraduate student worker labor movement because all our fights are one fight.

WAWU is a particularly well-functioning union. We are this collective and intelligent brainchild of hundreds or thousands of student workers. And, we have so much we've learned that we can share. And, we have so much to learn from others with more or different experiences, so we should.

I want to see a WAWU where collaboration beyond our campus, mentorship beyond our campus is not limited to our core organizers, but is something that we all engage in. The way to make this undergrad worker movement, this higher ed labor movement stronger is for all of us to work and learn from other unions across the country.
