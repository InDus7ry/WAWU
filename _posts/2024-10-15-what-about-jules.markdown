The race for local union president is the only contested race in our first union [election](https://www.wawu-union.org/wawu-elections/). My opponent is Jules Robichaux, an Undergrad RA in SMATE who started doing stuff with the union in May.

I think Jules is a great candidate and in many ways I think she and I are very similar. I say in my candidate statement that I represent what WAWU should be "queer, rank-and-file, militant undergraduate labor organizing" and we're both that. If you're looking for descriptive representation, I guess I'm brown and she's not. But yeah, no matter who wins the dolls will run this union and that's a win in my book.

Where I stand out is with experience. At face value I have 3 years of organizing experience, 2 years organizing with WAWU, 2 years in student government, 1 year bargaining, 4 months enforcing the contract. But subjectively I have more experience than that. I know the ESE contract like the back of my hand. I understand the structure and culture of the University's administration. I have a sober understanding of power and change. I understand the landscape of undergraduate labor.

The job of the Local Union President is described in the [International Constitution](https://uaw.org/uaw-constituion/). It's not detailed. However, it does say the president is supposed to preside over meetings and enforce the constitution.

I have a year of experience officially presiding over meetings as the AS Senate President and more if we consider WAWU and club meetings. I also have tons of experience with 'legal' documents like the constitution. But I don't think my having more experience than Jules in this regard really matters. These technical aspects of the position are not that complicated and I'm sure Jules would do fine with, I mean she did lots of the bylaws writing. I will say though, that the specifics and the details of the constitution are something that I don't struggle with in the way that a lot of other people even our UAW staff do struggle with.

The reason I think you should vote for me instead of Jules comes down to my vision, my competence, and my connections. I annoy people because I'm so often right (I'm also annoying about it), that's my competence. And then I also "get it" in a way that other people don't, that's my vision. I have lots of connections at Western and beyond.

I'm competent because I observe, I observe a lot. I soak up information like a sponge and I tend to remember it. That's why while I know the words of the contract like the back of my hand, I also know the context behind the words, and as such what the words *really* mean. That's why I understand how systems work: the University's system of administration, the PERC recognition process, the grievance process, the relations between international and local.

I "get it" because I'm not dogmatic. I accept the contradictions in everything I do. Abolitionist ideas and an arbitration based grievance system don't entirely mesh. Supporting victims and survivors and the union's duty of fair representation even for perpetrators might seem at odds. Understanding that mobilizing labor might be the only way to stop the genocide in Gaza, but not putting everything I've got into getting Western workers to strike for Palestine--that's a contradiction. And these contradictions are okay. I won't say I'm at peace with them, but I know we have to do the best we can and move forward. That's why I "get it" because I know how to win and I know that winning also means losing, that we can't always win everything all at once. That's my sober understanding of power and change.

When it comes to my connections that means the transition from Lexy to me as president would be mostly smooth, but I don't know if that's actually a reason for you to vote for me. It's like I'm saying "oh I'm already in power so you should just give me more power." But I think there is *some* value to the connections I already have, and that's that I'm a known quantity. The administration already knows how I handle them. They know that I handle them well, that I know how to say the things that need to be said, remember the things that need to be remembered, and not say the things that shouldn't be said. Some people have said that admin is scared of me, I'm not sure if that's true, but I know they take me seriously.

Now, Jules does have some things up on me. She's got a great presence, she fills the room in a different way than I do, and she has a confidence that I admire. But, I believe I can learn how to better orate and energize.

I won't fault anyone for voting for Jules instead of me. If I lose, I'll keep doing what I'm doing for our union and I hope that Jules would say the same.
