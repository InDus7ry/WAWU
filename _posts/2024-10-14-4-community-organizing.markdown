>WAWU is a powerhouse. We can make change on campus. We can make change in Bellingham. We can make change in Washington. The work that our union has been doing has already made change (WWU divestment MOU, helping keep 22N funded, increasing city minimum wage, etc.). As our Local matures, I want to see a CAP that effectively engages politics across a range of methods both tied to and separate from formal civic processes.

To be a force for good beyond our contract wins, we need to help organize the community. The arbitrary division between workers, students, the poor, the unemployed, the houseless doesn't matter. We are all experiencing the same crises: skyrocketing rent, greedflation, lack of health care, etc. And, we are all just a couple events away from changing from one category to another, for the better or worse.

>We should focus not only on electoral and civic politics, but also grassroots and non-traditional organizations to build new power in our communities.

The disciplined and intentional methods of labor organizing are what we can bring to community organizing. We bring a sober theory of change that focuses on what we can win right now and how we can set ourselves up for the future. We also bring energy and optimism as young people who have fought for change in our workplaces.

WAWU should keep collaborating with student movements on campus: the pro-Palestine movement, the environmental movement, the disability movement. These are all things that affect us and that we haven't been able to fully address with the tool of a contract. WAWU should set its sights on changing the academy for the better, on making Western a better place to work and to study.

>We have to accept contradictions in our political and community organizing.

We should engage a broad set of coalitions through our work in the CAP committee. We should keep showing up at events organized by other groups when the actions align with our immediate goals, even when our reasoning or our long-term goals diverge. CAP should be expansive. We should focus not only on electoral and civic politics, but also grassroots and non-traditional organizations to build new power in our communities.

We have to accept contradictions in our political and community organizing. We have to engage with civic processes because we can't ignore state power. And, we have to engage with abolitionist and grassroots campaigns building new power because there are some things the state will never do by itself. We have to work with people we disagree with because things need to get done, but we should never abandon our principles.
