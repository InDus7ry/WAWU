>WAWU is a powerhouse. We can make change on campus. We can make change in Bellingham. We can make change in Washington. The work that our union has been doing has already made change (WWU divestment MOU, helping keep 22N funded, increasing city minimum wage, etc.). As our Local matures, I want to see a CAP that effectively engages politics across a range of methods both tied to and separate from formal civic processes.
