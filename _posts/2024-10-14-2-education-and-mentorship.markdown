>Our 'careers' at Western are short, sometimes only 1 year, usually 2-3. That means that every year we're losing like a third of our unit, a third of our workplace leaders, a third of our organizers. So, we need new workplace leaders, new organizers, and a lot of them. To me, this means we need to continue building a robust general membership education program (i.e., orientations, training) and improve and expand our mentorship efforts.

My key takeaway after UAW Region 6 Summer School is that WAWU needs to improve its mentorship and education efforts. We already have an extensive general member education program (shoutout to all our Union Orientation leaders). But, what we need to keep WAWU healthy and growing is mentorship and leadership development.
