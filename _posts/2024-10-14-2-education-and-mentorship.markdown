>Our 'careers' at Western are short, sometimes only 1 year, usually 2-3. That means that every year we're losing like a third of our unit, a third of our workplace leaders, a third of our organizers. So, we need new workplace leaders, new organizers, and a lot of them. To me, this means we need to continue building a robust general membership education program (i.e., orientations, training) and improve and expand our mentorship efforts.

My key takeaway after UAW Region 6 Summer School is that WAWU needs to improve its mentorship and education efforts. We already have an extensive general member education program (shout-out to all our Union Orientation leaders). But, what we need to keep WAWU healthy and growing is mentorship and leadership development. I know, *sexy*.

Unions are kind of pyramid-shaped, I'm not gonna lie to you about that. I could call it the union onion or the [*Labor Notes* "bullseye",](https://www.labornotes.org/organizedpeople) but that's just a pyramid extruded along 360 degrees. However unlike the pyramid you see at [WWU](https://www.wwu.edu/campus-administration) the relations in our union pyramid are entered voluntarily and they're not designed around extraction, they're designed around solidarity.

>Every organizing conversation is an opportunity to develop leaders.

Someones gotta do the union things and some people are gonna end up doing more union things cause we're union nerds or care a lot or whatever. That means we're gonna have core organizers (the nerds and weirdos): Our group of Interim WAWU officers, UAW staff, and Gabe. That means we're gonna have organizers: our committees. That means we're gonna have workplace leaders and activists.

Except, we're not just 'gonna' have these different groups. We have to create ladders into these groups. Think [chutes and ladders](https://shop.hasbro.com/en-us/product/chutes-and-ladders-game/1095F835-5056-9047-F548-2F4D0AEF4ACC): labor edition. Guess what those ladders are. Did you guess *mentorship* and *leadership development*? Bingo.

I don't know if you've notice while browsing this website, but I like to make over-broad generalizations. Organizing is all just leadership development. Every organizing conversation is an opportunity to develop leaders. Right now the core organizers know this, but I want all of our organizers to know this. That's why I think WAWU needs an intentional program of mentorship and leadership development. Because the shrinking group of former ESE Bargaining Committee Members and our UAW staff can't keep WAWU well-organized without one.

>...even if I lose this election, more of us should be thinking critically about how we organize.

We need to expand this core group to the extent that a whole lot of us are thinking strategically about our union, that by the next executive board election every race is contested. We need to expand our roster of organizers so that each organizing committee point person doesn't have to individually organize 200 people. We need to expand our roster of workplace leaders so that when someone needs a break their workplace isn't disconnected from our union.

And, yes, I haven't been great at this myself, but that's what praxis is for. I recognize the challenges in my own organizing when I don't focus on leadership development and so now I'm trying to carry out an amended organizing theory. And I'm throwing this idea out there because even if I lose this election, more of us should be thinking critically about how we organize.
