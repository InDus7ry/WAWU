>We are mostly Undergraduate workers--how our union operates should reflect that. We exist in a higher ed labor context that has long prioritized the needs of white-collar academics (Tenured Faculty, Faculty, Adjuncts, Graduate Assistants). These workers make more money have more secure job prospects and generate more dues revenue. I want us to focus our efforts on Undergraduate workers--that means the OSE campaign, that means tutors, peer advisors, library assistants: the workers who don't do direct instruction or research and are likewise undervalued by the university and, historically, by the higher ed labor movement.
