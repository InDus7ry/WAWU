>At the core of our union, our key priority should ALWAYS be the maintenance of highly organized workplaces for a highly organized unit. That means, at a strategic level, putting organizing--building community with our coworkers--first.

The solution to essentially any issue we face as a union is organizing. Boss isn't treating you right? Organize! Having trouble getting people to show up to a union meeting? Organize! Coworkers don't know about the union? Organize! Your workplace isn't accepting of women and queer folk? Organize!

I joined our union because of an organizer, our most infamous, Lexy Aydelotte (our current interim President). I stayed in our union because organizing *is* building community--a community I became a part of. I've met 80% of my friends in Bellingham through organizing. I hold what we've all built with WAWU close to my heart.

>Nothing good in this world has come without someone organizing for it.

Anyone who was on the ESE bargaining committee probably has this same story. It was the 3rd morning of the strike, I slept though my alarm, we'd been bargaining until 2 a.m. or so, I
 was supposed to be on the picket line at 5 a.m., *I didn't show up until 11 a.m.* Everything was fine without me. It was the most powerful moment I exprienced: the organizing that we had been doing for the past 1-2 years made this happen. Our strike captains made this happen. That's the power of organizing. You want your organizing to be so successful that you are not a necessary part of mobilization.
 
 We have to organize, that's how we survive. I mean that insofar as *that's how our local union survives* but at a deeper level I mean that's how we, the working class, the proles, the exploited, the marginalized, that's how *we* survive. Nothing good in this world has come without someone organizing for it. Those raises that WWU "voluntarily" gave OSEs this fall, OSEs organized for them. The Ethnic Student Center, The Black Student Coalition, The Longhouse, these only exist on our campus because Black, Brown, and Indigenous Students fought for them. The Americans with Disabilities Act, that only exists because disabled people organized and mobilized for it.
 
>...an organized local is a thriving local.

 But back to *that's how our local union survives* what do I mean there? Well, the turnover trap is real. If we don't organize, WAWU ceases to exist in 4 years (or less). If we don't organize, our local union won't be able to operate: no more printing, no more tacos, no more insurance, no more union office, no more central labor council, and ultimately, no more local union.
 
 Organizing is also how our local union can thrive. Remember, our contract, is not self-enforcing. Our local union can thrive when we enforce our contract. Our local union can thrive when we organize around issues like anti-imperialism, renter's protections, worker protections. Our local can thrive when we mobilize to help members in need. All those things come down to organizing. So an organized local is a thriving local.
