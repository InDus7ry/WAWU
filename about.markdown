Hi, I’m Gabe Wong, I’ve been involved with WAWU-UAW since December 2022. I’ve been organizing, advocating, canvassing, bargaining, and showing up ever since.

I’m running for Local Union President because my union friends think I should. But also because I believe that I am highly qualified for the role and I feel that what I represent (queer, rank-and-file, militant undergraduate labor organizing) is what WAWU should be about.

In terms of the mechanics of the role, the kind of work I was doing in my last ESE job is very similar. I served as Senate President and Senator (a Peer Advisor in Student Government) over the past two years, trying to get student voices heard and doing lots of what some, but not me, might call–boring–administrative, strategic, and organizational work.

The dolls will run this union :3
