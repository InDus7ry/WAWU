# Gabe's Vision for WAWU-UAW Local 4929:
For our OSEs:
> "The company can do what they want with their recognition. We already have our union." -Alma Gomez Garc√≠a

## [Baseline Organizing](/2024/10/14/organizing.html)
At the core of our union, our key priority should ALWAYS be the maintenance of highly organized workplaces for a highly organized unit. That means, at a strategic level, putting organizing--building community with our coworkers--first.

## [Education and Mentorship (Internal)](/2024/10/14/education-and-mentorship.html)
Our 'careers' at Western are short, sometimes only 1 year, usually 2-3. That means that every year we're losing like a third of our unit, a third of our workplace leaders, a third of our organizers. So, we need new workplace leaders, new organizers, and a lot of them. To me, this means we need to continue building a robust general membership education program (i.e., orientations, training) and improve and expand our mentorship efforts.

## [Undergraduate Focus & Unit Equity](/2024/10/14/undergrad-focus.html)
We are mostly Undergraduate workers--how our union operates should reflect that. We exist in a higher ed labor context that has long prioritized the needs of white-collar academics (Tenured Faculty, Faculty, Adjuncts, Graduate Assistants). These workers make more money have more secure job prospects and generate more dues revenue. I want us to focus our efforts on Undergraduate workers--that means the OSE campaign, that means tutors, peer advisors, library assistants: the workers who don't do direct instruction or research and are likewise undervalued by the university and, historically, by the higher ed labor movement.

## [Community Organizing](/2024/10/14/community-organizing.html)
WAWU is a powerhouse. We can make change on campus. We can make change in Bellingham. We can make change in Washington. The work that our union has been doing has already made change (WWU divestment MOU, helping keep 22N funded, increasing city minimum wage, etc.). As our Local matures, I want to see a CAP that effectively engages politics across a range of methods both tied to and separate from formal civic processes.

## [Education, Leadership, and Mentorship (External)](/2024/10/14/external-education-and-leadership.html)
WAWU is iconic. We have made history with our union, with our contract, with our organizing. Other undergraduate unions are looking to us, other community organizations are looking to us. We should continue to collaborate with these unions and organizations and continue to share our insights.
